# Classroom-Shuffler

Schools never shuffle classrooms randomly. This really triggered me so I made this program.

HOW TO USE

1. Select your list of students (in a csv format).

2. Select where to save your output file.

3. Enter the number of classrooms required.

4. Click Shuffle Sections!

Enjoy!
